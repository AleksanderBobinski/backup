# My System Configuration Scripts

## Goal

My current laptop is dying. I expect to transition to a new one in the next
couple of years but I would like to keep most of my current configs.

There are two targets:
1. Have a set of scripts that would customize a base insulation of Arch with
most of the configs that I've picked up over the years.
2. Use this set of scripts to test system changes in a VM before applying them
on the live system.

## Requirements

### Working environments

There are three environments where the scripts must work.
different use-cases exist. The environments are:

1. A new machine
2. A test VM
3. A live system

Ideally one could ssh into the new machine from an old machine. If that is not
possible because the old machine was damaged then setting up a new machine
using a pendrive with an up-to-date ISO must be possible. The machine might not
be an running on an x86_64 CPU.

Taking into account the above it's safe to assume that the initial platform
specific setup cannot be part of the scripts here. Hence the forward going
assumption for the scripts must be that they will not have to do any platform
specific setup.

### Use Cases

The scripts must setup a system so that these are possible.

1. Update bootchain
2. Run system upgrade (pacman -Syu)
3. Recover from loosing passwords via 2FA tokens
4. Recover memorabilia
5. Run firefox
6. Recover financial spreadsheets
7. Recover CVs
8. Recover collected articles and books for offline reading, such as "Calculus
made easy"
